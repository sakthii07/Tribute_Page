                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Stephen William Hawking (1942–2018) was a renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist, recognized for his groundbreaking work in the fields of general relativity and quantum mechanics, particularly in relation to black holes. Despite being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the age of 21, he made significant contributions to science and popularized complex concepts through his books and public appearances.</p>

                    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                    <p>Born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, Stephen Hawking showed an early interest in science and the universe. He attended St Albans School and later University College, Oxford, where he studied physics. Although he found the academic environment unchallenging, he graduated with honors and went on to pursue a PhD in cosmology at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.</p>

                    <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
                    <p>Hawking's work on black holes and the theory of Hawking radiation was revolutionary. He proposed that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon, a concept that bridged the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics. His seminal book, "A Brief History of Time," brought these complex ideas to a broader audience, becoming a bestseller and establishing Hawking as a leading figure in science communication.</p>

                    <h2>Personal Life and Resilience</h2>
                    <p>Diagnosed with ALS, a neurodegenerative disease, at a young age, Hawking was given only a few years to live. However, he defied the odds, surviving for more than five decades with the condition. His determination to continue his research and outreach efforts despite his physical limitations was an inspiration to many. He communicated using a speech-generating device controlled by his cheek muscles, enabling him to continue his academic work and public engagements.</p>
